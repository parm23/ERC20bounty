Avoiding Common Attacks

Building Under the Secuity of ERC-20 and ERC-721 Token Standards

The Zeppelin Token Standads are natively equipped to resist against common attacks. OpenZeppelin is meant to provide secure, tested and community-audited code. The core development principles and strategies that OpenZeppelin is based on include: security in depth, simple and modular code, clarity-driven naming conventions, comprehensive unit testing, pre-and-post-condition sanity checks, code consistency, and regular audits.
